            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Anchor ("the App") is designed with your privacy as a priority. We believe your personal habits and routines are your business, not ours. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>
                <p><strong>The short version:</strong> Your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit your personal information to any servers.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
                <p>Anchor does not collect, store, or transmit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                    <li>Your routines, tasks, or habit data</li>
                    <li>App usage or completion history</li>
                    <li>Location data</li>
                    <li>Analytics or tracking data</li>
                    <li>Device identifiers</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
                <p>Anchor stores the following data locally on your device using Apple's secure on-device storage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Routines and Tasks:</strong> The routines you create, including task names, descriptions, and verification settings</li>
                    <li><strong>Completion History:</strong> Records of when you completed routines and tasks</li>
                    <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your chosen theme, settings, and blocked app selections</li>
                    <li><strong>NFC Tag and QR Code Identifiers:</strong> References to your anchor tags for task verification</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
                <p>Anchor requests certain device permissions to function. Here's what each permission is used for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Screen Time / Family Controls:</strong> Required to block and unblock apps as part of your routines. This data is managed entirely by iOS and is not accessible to us.</li>
                    <li><strong>NFC:</strong> Used to read NFC tags for task verification. Tag data is only used locally to match your anchors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used to scan QR codes for task verification. Images are processed locally and not stored or transmitted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> If you enable location-based triggers, your location is used locally to detect when you arrive at or leave a specified area. Location data is not transmitted or stored beyond what iOS requires for geofencing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to remind you about scheduled routines. Notification content is generated locally on your device.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Anchor does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
                <p>If you choose to make a voluntary donation through the App, the payment is processed by Apple through the App Store. Apple's privacy policy governs how they handle payment information. We do not receive or store any payment details.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Backup</h2>
                <p>If you use iCloud Backup, your Anchor data may be included in your device backup. This backup is encrypted and managed by Apple according to their privacy practices. We do not have access to your iCloud backups.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Anchor does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since we don't collect personal information from any users, there is no children's data to protect. The App may be used by users of all ages under parental guidance.</p>
